# 👋 Hey, I’m Ashok (aka @notashock)

Welcome to my GitHub profile—where my code works… most of the time. If it doesn’t, that’s just a feature waiting to be discovered.

## 👀 What I’m Into
Artificial Intelligence, because why not build something smarter than half the apps we use daily?  
Full-stack development, especially the MERN stack, because apparently I enjoy suffering on both frontend *and* backend.  
Also, systems that don’t randomly break at 3 AM—but that’s still a dream.

## 🌱 What I’m Learning
I’m deep-diving into MERN, trying to make my APIs behave like disciplined adults.  
Improving backend architecture, because one more spaghetti-code incident and I might actually lose it.

## 💡 Collaboration Interests
AI/ML projects that don’t ask me to reinvent the wheel,  
MERN stack apps where state management doesn’t scream at me,  
Open-source tools — mostly so I can complain about bad documentation while fixing it.

## ⚡ Fun Fact
I once spent 4 hours debugging a bug that didn’t exist anymore.  
Yes. The universe does have a sense of humour.

Thanks for visiting—hope my repos crash less often than your patience.
